Operated on a haplotype resolved assembly of grey Ericameria Nauseosa.

2 assemblies, hap_1 and hap_2 were created. Hap_2 was cleaner in its assembly, so it was used.

The two assemblies were compared, and large tracts of translocated elements are suggested between them. 

Investigation into the structural variation of ERNA in order to see if a large translocation or inversion
could diagnose green vs gray rabbitbrush.

108 non-hybrid populations were drawn from across the great basin and american west, representing either Grey or Green rabbitbrush.
Their rad-seq data will be aligned to the genome assembly.

Populations were aligned to the reference assembly. Genotypes were hard-called, and had an average depth of 4-5x.

Populations mapped onto a PCA gave a clear subgroup of grey rabbitbrush: those that come from 
more xeric climates. This group has been labelled 'Desert'. 

Tools such as lostruct and other structure-visualizers were attempted to be used, 
but depth was too thin for them to work. 

Next steps are to re-align and re-filter radseq data without doing hard genotype calls.
